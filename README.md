Another course project done for *Introduction to Programming* in *Innopolis University*. The purpose was to develop a *Web app* using only *Eiffel* programming language for backend processing with *SQLite*. In result *RSS* was created using *AngularJS* to make it a *SPA website*.

**Report Submission System** is a system that replaces the current manual processes as submitting and managing reports in the *Innopolis University*. With this system professors are able to make a report submission from any device connected to the Web, then all the reports are stored in one database which is therefore makes it easier for administrators to manage them.
